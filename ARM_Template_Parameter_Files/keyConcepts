<file_name>.json template file
<file_name>.parameters.json template parameter file

-Parameter names must match the template definition

-Schemas are different

- Support for all types supposed by ARM templates (integer, boolean, string, arrays, objects)

- For secure strings, we usually will pass null because a secured string is not something we want to store in a parameter file.

- However if we absolutely have to, we should use a Reference type to pass the string securely.
    N.B : A Reference allows us to create a reference to a parameter that is stored externally.

- If you pass a parameter thats defined in the file on the command line, the command line will take precedence.
